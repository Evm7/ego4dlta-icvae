## 📝 Preparation
### Install dependencies 
```bash
conda create -n icvae python=3.8
source activate icvae
cd [Path_To_This_Code]
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir outputs
```

### Ego4D videos and metadata
- Follow the procedure indicated in [EGO4D main page](https://ego4d-data.org/docs/data/features) on how to download the pre-extracted visual features from Slowfast 8x8 R101 pretrained in Kinetics400.
- Download all the annotations for FHO_LTA challenge (train,test, and validation) and add them into the annotations directory (together with json files preprocessed by us)/
- Modify config.yaml file and paths.py from data directory by adding the path information to this code ([PATH_TO_CODE_BASE]) and to the feature dataset downloaded from Ego4d and padded ([PATH_TO_DATASET])


## 🏋️‍️ Pretraining
This section is still under development. In the next days we will publish more information on how to test/train the project.
